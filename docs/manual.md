# Q-Rate Lite: Operations Manual

## For Café Owners

### Setup

1. Print the QR code generated in the Admin panel.
2. Place QR codes on tables.

### Daily Operations

- **Staff Page**: All staff should have the Staff Page bookmark on their phone.
- **Redeeming**: When a customer shows a coupon, staff enters the code on the Staff Page to validate and redeem it.
- **Feedback**: Review feedback daily on the Admin dashboard.

### Troubleshooting

- **WhatsApp Down**: If WhatsApp verification fails, the system might degrade (currently no fallback implemented, strict dependency).
- **Network Issues**: The PWA attempts to be robust but requires network for submission.

## Sudo (Internal)

- Access `/sudo` for global system status and kill-switches.
